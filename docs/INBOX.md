# Coordination inbox

Async, durable communication channel from feature lanes to the
coordination lane. Append entries at the **top** (newest first).
Coordination lane sweeps this on next session, addresses each open
entry, marks resolved.

## When to write here

- **Question** — about lane boundaries, procedure, BACKLOG priority,
  or anything in `docs/` that's unclear or contradicts what you see in
  code.
- **Note** — architectural surprise, pattern observed, gotcha
  discovered. Things that future sessions would benefit from knowing
  but don't fit memory or architecture docs yet.
- **Blocker** — your work is stuck on a coordination decision (e.g.
  two lanes both need to touch a shared abstraction; cross-lane
  schema migration sequencing).
- **Rule disagreement** — a `WORKFLOW.md` rule didn't work for you,
  produced a bad outcome, or felt arbitrary in a specific case. Worth
  feeding back so the rule can be refined.

## When NOT to write here

- A bug you found → goes in `BACKLOG.md` directly.
- A question about how a piece of code works → grep / read it.
- A real-time blocker that needs an immediate decision → tell the
  human directly, the inbox is async.
- A long-form design discussion → file as a proposal in
  `docs/proposals/<topic>.md` instead.

## Format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <lane>
**Type:** question | note | blocker | rule-disagreement
**Body:** <one paragraph; concrete>
**Status:** open
```

Coordination lane resolves by appending a `**Resolved:**` line:

```
**Resolved:** <one sentence + pointer to where the answer landed>
```

Resolved entries get archived to `docs/notes/inbox-archive.md`
periodically so this file stays short and scannable.

## Heads-up to the human

Adding an entry here does NOT auto-notify the coordination lane. The
human is the routing layer: when a session writes to the inbox, it
should also surface that to the human ("I left a coordination note
about X") so the human knows to bring it up the next time they're
talking to coordination.
